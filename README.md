# Detecting-Sponsored-Content-in-Spotify-Podcast-Data
This repository contains the code and documentation for my UCLA thesis project on detecting sponsored content in Spotify podcasts. The goal of this project is to mitigate difficult usage of machine learning models by using pre-trained hugging face transformer models
that can accurately identify segments within podcast metadata descriptions where the content is sponsored or contains advertisements. The results were used for a data analysis impactful in digital advertising and marketing.
